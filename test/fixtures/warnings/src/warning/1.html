        <h2>blue is a Systems Research Group</h2>

        <p class="lead">
        We design, build, and evaluate novel computer systems. We are currently
        working on smartphones, today's most pervasive mobile technology. Our
        research aims to make smartphones more useful, safer, and more sustainable.
        But at <a href="/">blue</a> we put people first. Our primary mission is to
        train computer scientists and our primary product is people. We try to align
        everything else in service of that goal, which results in putting
        <strong>people before projects before papers.</strong>

        </h3>

        <p>
        <strong>Putting people first</strong> reflects the fact that as an
        academic research group <a href="/">blue's</a> primary purpose is to
        train future researchers and developers. Lab members are in school and
        are here to learn. When conducting research, our objective is to allow
        students the chance to come up with new ideas, develop them into
        prototype systems, evaluate them objectively, and then communicate their
        results effectively to the broader scientific community. Along the way
        they are developing analytical skills and leadership abilities they
        benefiting the majority of their career in technology that occurs
        <i>after</i> they leave <a href="/">blue</a>.
      </p></div>

          <a href="/projects/">Projects <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
        </h3>

        <p>
        Putting <strong>people before projects</strong> means allowing <a href="/">blue</a> group members to choose and lead projects that excite
        them and letting projects proceed at a pace that benefits members' personal
        development. We utilize our freedom as an academic research lab to identify
        novel directions that we are excited about pursuing without the
        constraints of a company or industrial research lab. But along the way we
        are careful not to miss opportunities to allow <a href="/">blue</a> group
        members to learn and grow as they develop their projects—even if
        this means development doesn't always happen as fast as possible.

          <a href="/papers/">Papers <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
        </h3>

        <p>
        Putting <strong>projects before papers</strong> allows us to work on
        projects that interest us—not just ones that might quickly lead to
        a publication—and to publish when ready. While acceptance rates at
        many systems conferences are low enough to be discouraging, we believe
        that publishing should be a fundamentally happy undertaking. It's our
        chance to share what we've found with the world outside our group, and to
        celebrate the hard work and growth of <a href="/">blue</a> members. We
        also don't work on projects because we need to publish papers—we
        work on projects because we love building things and we're curious about
        what will happen when we try something new. </p>

        <h2>Together In the Lab</h2>

        <p>
        <a href="/">blue</a> is fortunate to have a single lab large enough to
        house all current group members—currently
        <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/buildings/building?id=davis" target="_blank" class="external">Davis Hall</a>
        Room 301B, also know as the PhoneLab. Inspired by the organization of
        groups like the Berkeley
        <a href="https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" class="external">AMP Lab</a>,
        as well as the organization of typical startups and technology
        companies, all group members—faculty, administrators, graduate students and
        undergraduates—work side-by-side in our lab. This arrangement
        allows for spontaneous real-time collaboration and problem solving while
        also building a sense of camaraderie. Group members are asked to be
        present in the lab during certain hours to facilitate interaction. New <a href="/">blue</a> members find it easy to get started since there are
        always more experienced developers nearby, and many discussions
        that take place in the lab have benefited from being overheard by group
        members that were not directly engaged in the project. It also just ends
        up being a lot of fun!
